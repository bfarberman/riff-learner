UPCOMING FEATURES:

Users will be able to pull up the notes for different riffs and melodies. The notes will be positioned next to an online keyboard, so the user can teach themselves the song. A link to stream the song will also be available, so the user can hear how it goes and play along.

WHY I WANTED TO BUILD THIS:

Learning is one of the joys of life. But with jobs and families, we often need to learn and practice things in small pieces. So here's an app that allows you to work on tiny parts of famous songs. A future version of this app could allow for adding different pieces of the same song. 

CHALLENGES:

I'm sure that putting all of the pieces together will pose a challenge. Ideally, one would click on a song and go to that page. The song would start playing, the notes would appear, the keyboard would work, and you could play along with the song. This will take some coordinating.
